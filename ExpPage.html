        <h3><i><u>Teaching Intern</u></i></h3>
         <p><b>Boddhi Tree Foundation (NGO) | Nov 2021 - Mar 2022</b></p>
            <p> - I have learnt a lot about how to be a good teacher. 
                My co inters have taught me how to work in a group 
                environment and handle stress.</p>
            <p> - Teaching children of under privileged background gave me 
                a different kind of satisfaction.
                 I felt at peace as I was doing a selfless deed.</p>
        <h3><i><u>Graphic Design Intern</u></i></h3>
         <p><b>CollegeTips.in | Mar 2022 - Apr 2022</b></p>
            <p> - I have learnt how to deal with stress and meet deadlines.</p>
            <p> - The work given was not hard but it was time consuming. 
                I did my best to give the quality output in the limited time.</p>
            <P> - This internship has taught me work can be fun too.</P>
